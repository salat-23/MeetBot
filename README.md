# Telegram MeetBot
MeetBot is an experimental bot which allows users to create profiles, meet and chat with others.

This project collected around 3000 users but was shutdown due to absense of monetization.

Features:
- Custom replies. Bot always picks a random reply phrase from the bot-data.xml file. It uses custom variable parsing.
- Allows to create, modify and delete your account!
- Boost system which favors users with higher boost value when searching for a match.
- Super flexible and extensible system for handling different type of user states and interactions.
- Automatically detect user location using telegram latitude and longitude with reverse-geocoding.
